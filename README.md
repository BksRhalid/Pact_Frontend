<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The objective of the exercise is to provide the unit tests of a smart contract including everts and revert.

In this context, we have created three test files: :

- `Ownable.test.js` : to test if Ownable from openzepplin is correctly implemented
  <br>
  ```sh
     Units tests on Ownable access functions
    🔎 Test Ownable Revert if the owner is not the caller
      ✔ should NOT start Proposal session registering if caller is not the owner (58ms)
      ✔ should NOT end Proposal session registering if caller is not the owner (46ms)
      ✔ should NOT start voting session if caller is not the owner (50ms)
      ✔ should NOT end voting session  if caller is not the owner (60ms)
      ✔ should NOT start tallyVotes if caller is not the owner (56ms)
  ```
- `Voting.test.js` : to test the each function of Voting smart contract separately
  <br>

  ```sh
    Units tests of each function of voting smart contract
    🔎 Deployment hardhat deploy testing
      ✔ should deploy the smart contract
    🔎 Get add new voters function unit test
      ✔ should emit event VoterRegistered
      ✔ should be able to set owner as a voter
      ✔ should add a new voter_1 and change bool isRegistered from false to true (40ms)
      ✔ should NOT add a new voter and revert caller is not the owner
    🔎 Get voters function unit test
      ✔ should return true for _owner and false for voter_1 not yet Registered
      ✔ should revert as voter is not registered
    🔎 AddVoter failed as voter registration is not open yet
      ✔ should NOT addVoter and revert with Voters registration is not open yet (95ms)
      ✔ should NOT addVoter if not the owner
    🔎 Get add new proposal function unit test
      ✔ should add a new proposal
      ✔ should emit event add proposal
    🔎  AddProposals failed as Proposals are not allowed yet
      ✔ should NOT addProposals and revert with Proposals are not allowed yet (109ms)
      ✔ should NOT addProposal if caller is not a Voter
    🔎 getOneProposal function unit test
      ✔ should NOT give proposal if not Voter (48ms)
    🔎 Get add new vote function unit test
      ✔ should add a new vote and increment voteCount
    🔎 Test revert setVote function unit test
      ✔ should revert setVote as the voting session not started (92ms)
      ✔ should revert as caller is not a voter (60ms)
      ✔ should revert with Voting session havent started yet (73ms)
      ✔ should revert with Proposal not found (47ms)
    🔎 Get end voting session function unit test
      ✔ should end the voting session (81ms)
    🔎 TallyVotes function unit test
      ✔ should return the winning proposal
      ✔ should change the status
    🔎 TallyVotes revert function unit test
      ✔ should NOT work if not votingSessionEnded
      ✔ should NOT work if not Owner (49ms)
  ```

- `VotingWorkflow.test.js` : to test the overall workflow of the Voting contract
  <br>
  ````sh
      Units tests for overall workflow of voting smart contract
    🔎 Control workflow status not allow to change if previous status is NOT correct
      ✔ should NOT start Proposal registering if the workflow status is not the expected one (67ms)
      ✔ should NOT end Proposal registering if the workflow status is not the expected one (63ms)
      ✔ should NOT start voting session in incorrect WF (62ms)
      ✔ should NOT end voting session if the workflow status is not the expected one (58ms)
      ✔ should NOT launch tallyVotes (65ms)
    🔎  Check event of each workflow status change
      ✔ should start Proposal registering if the owner
      ✔ should end Proposal registering if the owner
      ✔ should start voting session if the owner
      ✔ should end voting session if the owner
      ✔ should launch tallyVotes if the owner (45ms)
    ```
  ````

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Below the instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Here the list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- For this project we are going to use yarn

1.  installation

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

2. check installation

```sh
 yarn --version
```

- solidity

### Installation

\_Below instruction installing and setting up the project.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BksRhalid/Pact_Frontend.git
   git clone https://github.com/BksRhalid/Pact_Backend.git

   ```
2. Install packages

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. Enter your Wallet Private Key and API in `env`

   ```js
   const PK = "YOUR WALLET PRIVATE KEY";
   ```

   ```js
   const INFURA = "ENTER YOUR API";
   ```

   ```js
   const ETHERSCAN = "ENTER YOUR API";
   ```

4. Check dependencies used like Openzepplin contracts / hardhat-deploy

   ```sh
   yarn add --dev @openzeppelin/contracts
   yarn add --dev hardhat-deploy
   ```

In case of error:
\_TypeError: ethers.getContract is not a function

see reference : https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/130125/solvedpatrickcollins-solidity-course-2022-lesson-7-112038-typeerror-e

```sh
yarn add --dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
```
